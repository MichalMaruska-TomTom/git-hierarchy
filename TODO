Symbolic references:
 ref: refs/heads/xxxx

* How to dump this ref?

It seems that I can only resolve FULLY (i.e. the hash of head of xxxx).
I want the string "ref: refs/heads/xxxx".

For now I rely on the file.

# git show-ref $startref
# git symbolic-ref

* How to `delete' them?

git update-ref -d $baseref || true
 ... this deletes the referenced  Branch !!
git update-ref -d $startref || true




* Default to heads.
git-segment test master  should firts try:
git-segment test heads/master
