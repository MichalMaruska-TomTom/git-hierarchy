* Sample session:


you somehow have "master" to point at some base upstream commit.

$ git-segment bgnone master

will create branch-segment  "bgnone". You can see with  gitk(1),
that 2 references accompany this: start & base.

"start" is pointing at the commit, which is now current at "master",
"base" is pointing at the head "master".

That means, that when we "git pull", and "master" will move to follow
upstream "base" will move along with "master", but "start" will
remain.

... Commit something on bgnone

$  git-segment misc master
...  commit something on misc


$ git-sum all  bgnone misc
This declares the "sum" of the 2 features.

Now re-create the sum:
